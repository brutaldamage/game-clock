## Brutal Damage Game Clock

This is the chess clock app that we use during our weekly live streams to display the game clock on the stream.

The source is forked from [https://github.com/japtar10101/Chess-Clock-App](https://github.com/japtar10101/Chess-Clock-App). It has then been modified to support tracking control points for Warmachine & Hordes.

Additional changes include adding support for [Nanohttpd](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd) to create a webpage & websocket server so the game info can be viewed in a web browser. it is ulimately intended to be viewed in some form of a camera/live streaming utility application.
